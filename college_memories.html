      <p>
        My journey at Achariya College of Engineering and Technology has been one of growth, learning, and discovery.
        It is where I transformed from a curious learner into a confident engineer, gaining not just technical knowledge
        but also the discipline, teamwork, and creativity to apply it effectively. From academic milestones and innovative
        projects to cultural events and friendships that will last a lifetime, every experience at Achariya has played a
        vital role in shaping my personality, confidence, and passion for technology.
